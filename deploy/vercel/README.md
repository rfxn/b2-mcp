# OAuth-secured Vercel adapter

This is a supported serverless adapter for the existing B2 MCP HTTP pipeline.
It is not a Next.js app and does not add a UI. The public surface is:

- `POST /mcp`, plus SDK-required `GET` and `DELETE` behavior.
- `GET /health` for bounded readiness.
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and
  `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` for OAuth Protected Resource
  Metadata.
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` for compatibility metadata.

The portable OCI deployment in `deploy/customer-hosted` remains the primary
artifact. Use this adapter when an operator wants Vercel to host the MCP
resource server while keeping B2 keys in Vercel Production environment secrets.

## Architecture

```text
MCP client
  |
  | HTTPS + OAuth bearer token
  v
Vercel Node.js Function
  | validates OAuth by introspection or JWT/JWKS
  | rejects public B2 credential headers in server/principal mode
  v
src/http-fetch-handler.ts
  | credential provider
  | capability discovery and OAuth scope tool filtering
  | destructive-operation policy
  | audit and redaction
  | SDK v2 createMcpHandler
  v
Backblaze B2 Native and S3-compatible APIs
```

The MCP route is stateless. It does not use Redis, sticky routing, session
storage, `initialize`, or `Mcp-Session-Id` for MCP `2026-07-28` requests. Each
warm Vercel instance keeps its own process-local rate, concurrency,
token-verification, circuit-breaker, and capability caches. `B2_MAX_SESSIONS`,
`B2_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_KEY`, and `B2_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_*` are therefore per warm
instance on Vercel, not deployment-wide ceilings and not deployment-wide abuse
controls; effective capacity scales with the number of warm instances. OAuth
introspection and JWKS caches and circuit breakers are also per instance and
cold on cold start, so an authorization-server outage can still receive probes
from each warm instance. Treat those values as defense-in-depth and size B2,
the authorization server, and spend limits using Vercel Firewall, WAF,
deployment protection, and provider-side quotas for global controls.

## Deploy

Review `vercel.json` before creating the project. It disables framework
detection, uses the locked `@vercel/node` Function builder for `api/*.js`,
keeps Fluid Compute enabled, sets a bounded function duration, selects `iad1`,
and rewrites `/mcp` to the API function. The checked-in JavaScript API files are
thin launchers; the `vercel-build` hook runs repository typecheck/build and
compiles the typed Vercel adapter sources into `.vercel/build-runtime/` before
`@vercel/node` traces functions. The package engine range is
`^22.22.2 || ^24 || ^26`, while `vercel.json` explicitly pins the deployed
Vercel Function runtime to the reviewed `nodejs24.x` line. This intentionally
moves the Vercel deployment from the older Node 22 function runtime to the
reviewed Node 24 line; CI fails if generated `.vercel/output` runtime configs do
not match that pin. Change the region only after reviewing latency to your B2
account region; Vercel function region selection does not change B2 data
residency.

Set these in Vercel Project Settings, not in source:

| Setting | Production requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `B2_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_MODE` | `server` |
| `B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_HEADER_CREDENTIAL_MODE` | Omit unless intentionally enabling legacy header mode |
| `B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_SHARED_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` | Omit unless a reviewed deployment accepts sharing one B2 key across multiple subjects |
| `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` | Production-only encrypted environment value |
| `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` | Production-only encrypted environment value |
| `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Exact Vercel/custom hostname without wildcards |
| `B2_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Omit unless browser clients need specific origins |
| `B2_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY` | `block` for unattended/read-only, `confirm` for interactive |
| `B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS` | `false` |
| `B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES` | `false` |
| `B2_MCP_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | `json` until every client validates `toon` |
| `B2_ENABLE_MCP_PROMPTS` | `false` (off by default); set `true` once every replica runs prompt-capable code. Gates registration and advertisement together, so flip it atomically across the fleet (or use sticky routing) |
| `B2_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | Final public `https://.../mcp` URL |
| OAuth issuer/resource/audience | Exact operator values, no wildcard audience |
| `B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS` | Exactly one subject for the supported single-tenant `server` mode |
| OAuth verifier settings | Configure introspection credentials for opaque tokens, `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI` for JWT-only verification, or both when introspection should remain authoritative |
| Rate/concurrency values | Explicit reviewed per-warm-instance values |

Use `deploy/vercel/vercel.env.example` as a checklist. Do not set
`B2_MASTER_KEY_*` unless you separately document and review a Partner API use
case. Do not put any B2 or OAuth value in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, deploy-button query
defaults, build output, source maps, generated URLs, or logs.

## Authorization server

This adapter is an OAuth resource server, not an authorization server. Configure
your authorization server to issue access tokens for exactly the MCP resource
URL and audience in `B2_OAUTH_RESOURCE` / `B2_OAUTH_AUDIENCE`.

The supported `server` credential mode is single-tenant: one verified OAuth
subject uses one server-held B2 application key. Configure exactly one
`B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS` value matching the token `sub`, or
`issuer#sub`, for that tenant. This prevents multiple unrelated principals
from sharing one broad B2 credential without bucket or prefix authorization.
Use `principal` mode when different verified principals need distinct B2
credentials. `B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_SHARED_SERVER_CREDENTIAL=true` exists only for a
separately reviewed deployment where the operator accepts that every allowed
principal can access everything the shared B2 key can access.

Token validation uses the authorization server's RFC 7662 introspection
endpoint for opaque tokens, or local JWT verification when `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI`
is configured without introspection. When both are configured, introspection is
authoritative so authorization-server revocation, inactive-token responses, and
JWT-shaped opaque tokens are handled consistently during rollout. JWKS-only
mode validates signatures and claims locally but cannot observe server-side
revocation before token expiry, so pair JWKS-only mode with short IdP
access-token lifetimes (the revocation window equals the token lifetime), or
configure introspection alongside JWKS when immediate revocation is required.
JWKS verification uses the `jose` library to check the JWT signature against
the issuer's published keys, caches the JWKS for
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` with a minimum floor from
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_CACHE_MIN_TTL_SECONDS`, coalesces concurrent fetches, uses a
circuit breaker, and rate-limits forced refresh for normal key rotation.
The adapter additionally checks:

- active token response
- exact `iss`
- exact `resource` and `aud` for introspection
- JWT `aud` or `resource` binding to this deployment
- `exp`, `nbf`, and JWT `iat` with bounded `B2_OAUTH_JWT_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS`
- token type, when returned
- JWT header `typ`, defaulting to RFC 9068 access-token types (`at+jwt`); an
  issuer that omits `typ` or sends a different value needs
  `B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_JWT_TYPES` set to accept it
- a JWT header `kid` identifying the JWKS signing key; local JWT verification
  rejects tokens without a `kid`, so the issuer must include one (common
  providers do)
- token signing algorithm from the JWT header or introspection `alg`,
  `jwt_alg`, or `token_alg`, matched against `B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_ALGORITHMS`
- at least one of `b2:read`, `b2:write`, or `b2:admin`
- a subject listed in `B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS`, when configured
- any scopes listed in `B2_OAUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPES`

Introspection calls are bounded by `B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, retried
within `B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_RETRIES`, and fail closed through a small
process-local circuit breaker. Successful verified tokens are cached by token
hash for at most `B2_OAUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, never beyond the token's
`exp` minus `B2_OAUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SKEW_SECONDS`, with
`B2_OAUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` bounding memory.
JWKS fetches use `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_TIMEOUT_MS`, `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_RETRIES`,
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_CIRCUIT_*`, and
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_MS`. Introspection
requires either `B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID` plus
`B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET`, or
`B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_BEARER_TOKEN`. Only set
`B2_OAUTH_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_INTROSPECTION=true` for a reviewed
local or lab authorization server. Introspection credentials and
`B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT` are optional when only JWKS-backed JWT access
tokens are accepted.

Scope behavior is cumulative with B2 capabilities. `b2:read` exposes reviewed
read/list/inspect tools, `b2:write` also exposes object and bucket mutations
allowed by the B2 key and destructive policy, and `b2:admin` exposes
administrative operations such as keys, notifications, Object Lock protection,
and Partner/Groups stubs. OAuth never grants a tool the B2 application key
cannot use.

## Preview

Production B2 secrets must be assigned to Production only. Preview deployments
should use no B2 credentials, deterministic fakes, or a separate disposable
read-only key. The adapter refuses Preview deployments that contain
`B2_APPLICATION_KEY_*`, `B2_APP_KEY_*` (retired but still guarded as a
possible live secret), `B2_MASTER_KEY_*`, or `B2_CREDENTIAL_<REF>_*` material
unless `B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_PREVIEW_B2_CREDENTIALS=true` is set.

Legacy header credential mode is disabled on Vercel unless
`B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_HEADER_CREDENTIAL_MODE=true` is set. Server mode is the
supported production mode because B2 credentials stay in Vercel Production
environment secrets and are never supplied by the MCP client.

Protect Preview deployments with Vercel Deployment Protection. If CI must reach
a protected Preview, send `x-vercel-protection-bypass` from a protected GitHub
environment secret. Never put the bypass token in a query string, PR-authored
file, test output, or logs.

## Smoke

After deployment:

```bash
curl -fsS https://b2-mcp.example.com/health
curl -fsS https://b2-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <access-token>" \
  MCP_URL=https://b2-mcp.example.com/mcp \
  B2_MCP_SMOKE_CREDENTIAL_MODE=server \
  B2_MCP_EXPECTED_TOOL_PROFILE=phase1-default \
  pnpm run smoke
```

`/health` validates the static Vercel credential and OAuth configuration
without calling B2. It returns 503 until required OAuth and credential
environment variables are complete; this is expected during incremental
project setup and distinct from a crashed function.

For protected Preview smoke, include the Vercel bypass header only through a
protected CI secret. The smoke workflow supports `headers`, `server`, and
`principal` credential modes; `server` mode sends no B2 key headers and uses
`MCP_AUTHORIZATION`.

CI also runs Vercel adapter protocol parity through the modern `2026-07-28`
suite and the separately named 2025-era fallback suite. The package-budget job
writes a Vercel bundle estimate to `reports/vercel-bundle/` without requiring
Production B2 secrets. The `Vercel build output scan` job runs
`typecheck`, `build`, then a real token-free `vercel build` through the
lockfile-backed `vercel@59.26.0` CLI and `@vercel/node@13.0.0` builder. It
also rejects any Vercel builder TypeScript diagnostics before the generated
artifact can be scanned as clean. The `vercel-build` hook performs the same
typecheck/build gate on real Vercel deploys before the JavaScript launchers are
traced. The scan job also writes the child process a minimal non-secret
environment only: process path
variables, CI/color/temp knobs, `NODE_OPTIONS`, a temp `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`,
disabled Vercel telemetry, an empty `VERCEL_TOKEN`, and deterministic scanner
canaries. Generic caller tokens such as npm, GitHub Actions, AWS, Sentry, and
Vercel credentials are not forwarded to the builder graph. The job
writes sanitized scan evidence to `reports/vercel-build-output/` and fails if
the output contains static assets, dotenv files, secret-shaped values,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` markers, embedded function environment values, an unreviewed
function runtime, or a runtime `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1 bundle. The
token-free CI job can exact-match only synthetic sensitive env values supplied
to the scanner; it is not evidence that Production-injected secrets were absent
from a separate deploy. Promote only commits where this gate passed.

## Runtime limits

This adapter keeps the application-level MCP body limit at one MiB regardless
of Vercel's current platform limit. Do not proxy large object bodies through
the function. Use bounded inline payloads or short-lived B2 presigned URLs so
bytes move directly between the client and B2.

## Promotion and rollback

Only promote reviewed `main` or release-tag commits to Production. Record the
Git SHA, npm version, container digest when applicable, Vercel deployment ID,
MCP revision, and tool-contract hash in the release record. Production smoke
must pass before declaring the deployment healthy.

To roll back, use the previous Vercel Production deployment from the Vercel
dashboard or CLI, then rerun protected smoke. Rolling code back does not
restore a rotated or revoked B2 key; if the old deployment expects old secret
material, update the Vercel environment value deliberately before redeploying.

## Rotation, disablement, and teardown

Rotate by creating a new least-privilege B2 application key, updating the
Production-only Vercel environment value, deploying a new Production build, and
revoking the old B2 key after smoke passes. For immediate disablement, remove
the Vercel deployment or set `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to a non-matching value, then
revoke the B2 key. For teardown, delete the Vercel project and revoke the B2
application key from the Backblaze console or CLI.
