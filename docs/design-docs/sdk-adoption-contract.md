# Official B2 SDK Adoption and Tool Parity Contract

Issue: [#71](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/71)
Planning ID: `P1-SDK-01`
Reviewed SDK: `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.4.0` from npm, verified 2026-09-01
Target MCP revision: `2026-07-28`

This record supersedes the implementation allowance in
[#55](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/55) that treated direct B2
HTTP calls as acceptable Phase 1 architecture. The official Backblaze TypeScript
SDK is the required native B2 integration boundary for Phase 1 migration and
for the public MCP tool contract freeze. Issue
[#126](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/126) makes the AWS SDK
the permanent S3-compatible data-plane boundary for `s3_*` tools, configured
through the SDK `/s3` helper.

## Binding Decision

- Runtime B2 integration must consume a stable npm release of
  `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`, pinned at one reviewed version in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- The reviewed version for this record is `0.4.0`. Release builds may consume
  npm artifacts only, not unpublished Git branches, local SDK checkouts, SDK
  private files, or package-internal `dist/internal/*` modules.
- Preferred integration order is the public high-level facade from
  `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`, then documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/raw`, then
  documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/partner`, then documented
  `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3`, then composition of public SDK operations.
- Direct B2 HTTP transports are not allowed in runtime code. AWS SDK S3 usage is
  allowed only through `src/s3/aws-sdk-adapter.ts` and must be anchored through
  the SDK's documented `/s3` helper path.
- Missing native B2 SDK capabilities must be tracked upstream and must land in a
  stable SDK release before the MCP release can claim that capability as an
  SDK-backed native contract.
- The MCP protocol baseline remains `2026-07-28`. The modern MCP runtime uses
  the stable v2 server entry points through `createMcpHandler` and `serveStdio`.
  A repository-owned Node HTTP bridge adapts the web-standard handler without
  `@modelcontextprotocol/node` or its web-framework dependency. The monolithic
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1 package is not an allowed direct or runtime
  dependency; the only allowed lockfile presence is a dev-only transitive of the
  locked Inspector CLI.

## Package Policy

- `package.json` pins `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` exactly to the reviewed version.
  The lockfile pins the resolved tarball and integrity.
- The SDK is intentionally pre-provisioned in runtime dependencies before source
  code imports it. This freezes npm provenance, engine-floor, and package-review
  policy before migration code starts handling durable B2 credentials.
- Dependabot or Renovate SDK version bumps require the SDK parity matrix to be
  reviewed and the complete SDK/MCP no-credential contract to pass:
  `pnpm run test:contract`, `pnpm run test:protocol`,
  `pnpm run test:package`, `pnpm run check:package-budget`, and
  `pnpm run audit:supply-chain`. The live contract suite must pass before
  release accepts the SDK upgrade.
- SDK dependency bumps must not be auto-merged; the `b2-sdk` dependency group
  requires human parity, provenance, and engine-floor review.
- A release candidate must fail review if it relies on SDK private modules,
  unpublished commits, or undocumented exports.
- SDK updates must include evidence for secret custody, abort propagation,
  retries, pagination, response-shape changes, and error translation changes.

### Release-Age Exception For `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.4.0`

Issue [#344](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/344) requires
`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.4.0`, and that exact npm version was published at
`2026-09-01T18:50:49.255Z`, inside the repository minimum-release-age window at
the time of adoption. The root and customer-hosted workspaces carried a temporary
exact-version `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entry for
`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.4.0` so frozen installs could verify the reviewed
lockfile while the cooldown elapsed. The exception expired at
`2026-09-16T19:00:00.000Z`, and the exclusion has been removed from both
workspaces. Future SDK bumps must
either wait out the release-age window or add a new reviewed, time-bounded
exception.

Exception evidence:

- Npm provenance metadata advertises a SLSA v1 attestation at
  `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/attestations/@backblaze-labs%2fb2-sdk@0.4.0`.
- The registry tarball is
  `https://registry.npmjs.org/@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/-/b2-sdk-0.4.0.tgz`, with
  shasum `9ee4ccf69ee641b74c1d19ddab3e49571e9e357e`.
- The registry integrity is
  `sha512-Xs5dHWF2YNDVaZpumgJAAqy1rFYVw1F8l2ZAsKL36AA6lwpxuqjRHPgwQMX92WiowQLCl5O1bZRjD3pVJA7m+Q==`;
  both `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `deploy/customer-hosted/pnpm-lock.yaml` pin this
  exact value.
- `npm diff --diff=@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.3.0 --diff=@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk@0.4.0 --diff-name-only`
  was reviewed for the package update. The expected expansion is the Partner
  single-object create/reserve correction, public `reserveTrialAccount` facade,
  Partner redaction updates, and generated JS/CJS/type/map artifacts from the
  SDK build.
- Published package metadata has no `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, or
  `prepare` lifecycle script, so install-time code execution is not introduced
  by this exception.

## S3 Tool-Name Decision

The public `s3_*` names are compatibility names for B2's S3-compatible endpoint.
Issue [#126](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/126) makes the
repository-owned AWS S3 peer adapter the permanent implementation boundary for
retained S3 data-plane tools, with endpoint and credential configuration derived
through the documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3` helper. Native `b2_*` tools
remain on the B2 SDK facade/raw boundary.

The contract freeze must apply these rules:

- Retain an `s3_*` name when the operation's public contract is S3-material:
  S3 object operations, endpoint reachability, S3 region/location probing,
  presigned URLs, multipart upload semantics, upload-part-copy, or
  `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload`.
- Keep AWS SDK construction isolated to `src/s3/aws-sdk-adapter.ts`; tool
  handlers consume the repository-owned adapter contract and must not construct
  AWS clients directly.
- Preserve existing model-visible descriptions, schemas, capability maps,
  response casing, pagination fields, and profile hashes unless a separate
  contract-version decision explicitly approves drift.

## Public Tool Backing Taxonomy

Documentation and customer-facing tool catalogs assign every tool to exactly
one backing category:

1. Native B2 SDK (`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`) for B2 control-plane operations the
   S3 API has no equivalent for. This includes bucket, key, Object Lock,
   notification, and Partner/Groups operations, even when a durable-secret
   producer is currently exposed only as an unavailable compatibility stub.
2. AWS S3 SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) for the S3-compatible data plane. These are
   the retained `s3_*` names implemented through the repository-owned AWS peer
   adapter and configured through the B2 SDK `/s3` helper.
3. Neither SDK for repository-owned MCP analytics. These tools may compose
   SDK-level reads and listings, but the requested operations, such as storage
   growth, egress ranking, largest-file discovery, and unfinished-upload
   analysis, are custom MCP behavior because no SDK exposes them as primitives.

Availability is orthogonal to backing. The current unavailable rows are
durable-secret-producing Native B2 SDK operations blocked by the no-durable-secret
policy until an approved out-of-band sink exists; they are not a fourth backing
category.

## Remaining SDK Context

- S3-only helper coverage:
  [backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript#154](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript/issues/154)
  remains historical context; `s3_*` data-plane tools use the AWS SDK directly
  through the repository-owned adapter.

## Runtime Import Inventory

These are the current runtime call sites that must be migrated, wrapped by the
official SDK, or explicitly justified as S3-material compatibility paths.

| Source                      | Runtime import                  | Current purpose                                                                                                                              | Contract disposition                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/s3/aws-sdk-adapter.ts` | `@aws-sdk/client-s3`            | Central S3 data-plane adapter for retained `s3_*` tools and usage-report object reads through SDK `/s3` configuration                         | Permanent S3-compatible data-plane dependency; all runtime AWS client usage must enter through this adapter and stay anchored by `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3` `createS3ClientConfig`. |
| `src/s3/aws-sdk-adapter.ts` | `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` | Adapter-owned S3 object and multipart presigning for `s3_get_presigned_url` and `s3_get_presigned_upload_part_url`                                      | Permanent S3-compatible presigning dependency; all runtime presigning must enter through this adapter.                                                                         |

Package note: `@aws-sdk/s3-presigned-post` is intentionally absent because there
is no runtime source import or approved MCP tool row for S3 POST Object form
uploads. It must not be reintroduced unless a reviewed SDK-backed contract row
adds a supported use.

## Shared Migration Semantics

- Secret custody: B2 application keys, master keys, authorization tokens,
  upload authorization tokens, and presigned URLs must not be logged, persisted
  in fixtures, or returned unless the specific row says a bearer result is the
  tool's purpose. Durable secret-producing handlers remain disabled in the
  default profile until an out-of-band secret sink exists; their tool names may
  remain as non-secret compatibility stubs for stale `tools/list` clients.
- Abort propagation: when the SDK method accepts `AbortSignal`, pass the MCP
  request signal through. If a selected SDK facade method lacks request-level
  abort support, the row must say so and the implementation issue must either
  switch to a raw method that accepts a signal or track the SDK gap.
- Retries and idempotency: native SDK clients are configured with the MCP-owned
  retry envelope formerly used by `withRetry`: 3 retries, 1s initial
  exponential backoff, 4s maximum backoff, and a 30s per-attempt timeout. The
  SDK retries transient transport/B2 errors and refreshes expired auth tokens.
  Native retry sends are gated by the process-wide retry budget and circuit
  timeouts propagate an abort signal to the SDK transport; mutating MCP tools
  still need their own idempotency contract because SDK retries do not make a
  lost-success create, copy, multipart finish, or secret-producing call safe.
  The AWS S3 peer retains SDK retries for read-like calls, while side-effecting
  S3 mutations are sent through the adapter-owned one-attempt client so the SDK
  cannot replay object or multipart writes under the MCP circuit envelope.
- Pagination: preserve the MCP tool's existing cursor names and caps unless the
  row explicitly changes them. SDK paginators may be used internally, but MCP
  responses must keep bounded output and explicit continuation fields.
- Error translation: SDK `B2Error` subclasses and S3 peer errors must normalize
  through the existing MCP `toolError` shape with status, B2/S3 error code, and
  provider request IDs when present.

## Tool Parity Matrix

Each retained row has exactly one reviewed implementation class:

- `facade`: public high-level `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` facade.
- `raw`: documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/raw`.
- `partner`: documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/partner`.
- `s3`: documented `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3` helper plus the permanent
  repository-owned AWS S3 peer adapter.
- `compose`: repository-owned MCP behavior composed from public SDK operations;
  for the analytics rows this maps to the neither-SDK backing category.
- `defer`: intentional v0.1 deferral or contract change.

## Partner Groups Lifecycle Coverage Decision

Glama's Server Coherence review ([#360](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/360),
tracked by [#366](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/366)) flagged
that the Partner Groups surface exposes membership operations
(`b2_list_groups`, `b2_list_group_members`, `b2_create_group_member`,
`b2_eject_group_member`) but no create/update/delete for the Group entities
themselves. The finding is recorded here rather than answered with new tools.

**Finding: the B2 Partner API exposes no Group create/update/delete endpoint.**
The reviewed `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/partner` client and its documented raw
peer expose exactly these Group-related operations and nothing that mutates a
Group's lifecycle:

| SDK method                                   | MCP tool                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `listGroups` / `paginateGroups`              | `b2_list_groups`          |
| `listGroupMembers` / `paginateGroupMembers`  | `b2_list_group_members`   |
| `createGroupMember`                          | `b2_create_group_member`  |
| `ejectGroupMember`                           | `b2_eject_group_member`   |

There is no `createGroup`, `updateGroup`, or `deleteGroup` on either the
`partner` facade (`PartnerClient`) or the documented `partner/raw`
(`PartnerRawClient`), and the B2 Partner API publishes no matching
`b2_create_group` / `b2_update_group` / `b2_delete_group` endpoint. Group
lifecycle (creating, renaming, or deleting a Group) is an **admin-console-only**
operation with no public API or SDK surface to wrap.

**Decision: no new Group tools.** Because the capability is not exposed by the
Partner API/SDK, there is nothing to add — Group lifecycle is not an intentional
omission of an available endpoint but the absence of one. Should Backblaze later
publish Group create/update/delete endpoints, adding them would still be weighed
against the deliberately lean 40-tool surface, and callers would be pointed at
the admin console in the interim. The Groups membership rows above remain the
complete Partner Groups tool coverage.

## Release Gate For #49

[#49](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-mcp/issues/49) must not freeze tool
names, descriptions, schemas, capability maps, response fixtures, or profile
hashes until this matrix and the SDK implementation issues it creates are
complete. The frozen contract must identify the resolved
`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` version and must fail if direct B2 HTTP behavior or
AWS behavior outside the reviewed S3 adapter silently reappears.
