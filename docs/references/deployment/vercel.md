# Vercel Node.js Functions

Shared guide: docs/references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md

## Status

Support level: supported and continuously tested. The adapter shipped in
`deploy/vercel/` and is covered by unit, protocol, bundle-budget, and policy
tests. This guide documents that adapter; it does not create another Vercel
route or protocol implementation.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel project imported from this repository.
- A custom hostname such as `mcp.example.com`.
- A non-master, least-privilege B2 application key.
- An OAuth authorization server with an introspection endpoint, a JWKS URI for
  signed JWT access tokens, or both.
- Node.js runtime support matching repository policy: `22.23.1`, `24`, or `26`.

## Architecture

```text
MCP client -> Vercel Node.js Function -> deploy/vercel/adapter.ts
  -> src/oauth-resource-server.ts -> src/http-fetch-handler.ts -> Backblaze B2
```

The public routes are `/mcp`, `/health`,
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`,
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, and
`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.

## Setup

Review `vercel.json`. It disables framework detection and uses the
lockfile-backed `@vercel/node` Function builder rather than the Edge runtime
because this server uses the repository's Node-aware SDK, B2 SDK, AWS S3
compatibility path, Pino, timers, and shared HTTP code. The checked-in
`api/*.js` files are thin launchers; the package `vercel-build` hook runs
repository `typecheck`/`build` and compiles `deploy/vercel/**/*.ts` plus `src/`
into `.vercel/build-runtime/` before `@vercel/node` traces functions. The
package engine range is `^22.22.2 || ^24 || ^26`; the Vercel builder config
explicitly pins the deployed Function runtime to `nodejs24.x`. This is an
intentional move from the previous Vercel Node 22 function runtime to
Vercel's reviewed Node 24 line, and CI fails if the generated `.vercel/output`
Function runtime changes before the pin and allowed runtime set are reviewed.
Import the repository into Vercel and keep the project framework setting
disabled.

Use [`../../../deploy/vercel/README.md`](../../../deploy/vercel/README.md) as the
operator runbook for exact route and environment behavior.

## Secrets

Set production-only Vercel environment secrets:

```bash
B2_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_MODE=server
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=your-application-key-id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your-application-key-secret
B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS=mcp.example.com
B2_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY=block
B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS=false
B2_SECRET_SINK=off
B2_ALLOW_INLINE_SECRETS=false
B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES=false
B2_MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

Use `deploy/vercel/vercel.env.example` as the checklist. Do not set Production
B2 credentials on untrusted Preview deployments. Protected Preview smoke may
use `x-vercel-protection-bypass` only from a protected GitHub Environment
secret.

## Deployment

Deploy from a reviewed `main` commit or release tag where the required
`Vercel build output scan` check passed. That job runs repository
`typecheck`, `build`, and a token-free real Vercel build before accepting the
generated artifact, and it fails on Vercel builder TypeScript diagnostics. The
Vercel build should use the checked-in API launchers and `deploy/vercel/adapter.ts`;
do not copy `src/http-fetch-handler.ts` into a second route implementation.

## Domains And TLS

Use a Vercel custom domain with HTTPS. Set `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the exact
hostname and `B2_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` only for reviewed browser clients. Do not
expose raw port 3000. Do not put B2 or OAuth values in deployment URLs or
deploy-button query defaults.

## Authentication

The adapter validates OAuth bearer tokens through
`src/oauth-resource-server.ts` before resolving B2 credentials. It accepts
opaque tokens through introspection and signed JWT access tokens through
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI` when JWKS-only mode is selected. If both are configured,
introspection remains authoritative for revocation and JWT-shaped opaque-token
compatibility. Server mode is single-tenant by default and requires one
`B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS` value unless
`B2_VERCEL_ALLOW_SHARED_SERVER_CREDENTIAL=true` is separately reviewed.

## Health Checks

`GET /health` checks static configuration and returns bounded metadata without
calling B2. It returns 503 until OAuth and B2 credential settings are complete.

## Smoke Testing

Run the shared smoke from docs/references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md:

```bash
MCP_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <access-token>" \
B2_MCP_SMOKE_CREDENTIAL_MODE=server \
B2_MCP_EXPECTED_TOOL_PROFILE=phase1-default \
pnpm run smoke
```

Record the Vercel deployment ID, deployed commit, Node runtime, MCP revision,
tool-contract hash, and smoke result.

## Logs

Use Vercel logs only for redacted diagnostics. Never log B2 credentials, bearer
tokens, presigned URLs, OAuth authorization responses, or deployment bypass
tokens.

## Scaling

The MCP route is stateless. Warm Vercel instances have process-local rate
limits, B2 capability caches, OAuth token-verification caches, and concurrency
counters. Use Vercel Firewall, WAF, spend controls, and provider quotas for
deployment-wide abuse controls.

## Rollback

Promote and roll back by immutable Vercel deployment identifiers. A code
rollback does not restore a revoked B2 key; update secrets deliberately before
redeploying an older build.

## Secret Rotation

Create a replacement B2 key, update the Production-only Vercel environment
secret, deploy, run smoke, then revoke the old key.

## Teardown

Delete the Vercel project or production deployment, remove environment secrets,
delete custom domains if unused, and revoke the B2 key.

## Limitations

Do not proxy large object bodies through Functions. This server enforces a
one-MiB MCP body cap; use short-lived B2 presigned URLs for large transfers.
Review current Vercel function duration, payload, bundle, region, concurrency,
and Fluid Compute limits before each production verification.

## Cost Controls

Set provider spend controls and rate limits. Use `B2_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY=block`
for unattended deployments and direct large object bytes to B2 instead of the
function runtime.

## Troubleshooting

Use the shared security contract first:
[docs/references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md](security-and-credentials.md).

- Auth discovery: fetch `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` and confirm the resource URL, issuer, authorization endpoint, and supported scopes match the MCP client configuration.
- Issuer/audience mismatch: compare `B2_OAUTH_ISSUER`, `B2_OAUTH_RESOURCE`, and `B2_OAUTH_AUDIENCE` with the token claims returned by the authorization server.
- Host/Origin rejection: confirm the public host is in `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and any browser-origin caller is in `B2_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; do not expose raw port 3000 while testing a bypass.
- Missing B2 capabilities: verify the B2 key has the specific read/write/admin capabilities required by the called tool and that `B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS` has not hidden a discovery failure.
- Timeouts: check the platform request timeout, OAuth introspection timeout, upstream B2 latency, and any proxy idle timeout before increasing MCP limits.
- Bundle limits: run the repository bundle or package budget check for this deployment path and remove unreviewed dependencies before raising limits.
- Cold starts: inspect platform cold-start logs, minimum instance settings, and secret-loading latency; keep health checks separate from expensive B2 calls.
- Failed health checks: call `GET /health` with the expected Host header, then verify credential-mode env vars, OAuth metadata env vars, and provider secret injection.
