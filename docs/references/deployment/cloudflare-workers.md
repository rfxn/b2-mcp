# Native Cloudflare Workers

Shared guide: docs/references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md

## Status

Support level: experimental compatibility. The repository includes
`deploy/cloudflare-worker/` with deterministic unit, protocol, typecheck, and
source-graph budget tests, but no protected live Worker smoke has been recorded
for this release. Do not call a tenant Worker deployment supported until that
clean deploy and smoke evidence exists.

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare Workers account and Wrangler.
- A custom Worker domain such as `mcp.example.com`.
- A non-master, least-privilege B2 application key.
- OAuth issuer with introspection, JWKS for signed JWT access tokens,
  Cloudflare OAuth Provider, or Cloudflare Access integration that yields
  verified standard MCP `AuthInfo`.
- Review of current Worker CPU, memory, subrequest, stream, and bundle limits.

## Architecture

```text
MCP client -> Cloudflare Worker fetch handler
  -> deploy/cloudflare-worker/adapter.ts
  -> src/oauth-resource-server.ts
  -> src/http-fetch-handler.ts
  -> Backblaze B2
```

Workers are fetch-native and skip `src/utils/node-web-bridge.ts`. The adapter
does not use Cloudflare `agents/mcp/server`, `McpAgent`, or a second MCP
protocol handler.

## Setup

Use `deploy/cloudflare-worker/wrangler.jsonc`. It pins
`compatibility_date` to `2026-08-14`, enables `nodejs_compat`, configures a CPU
budget, and lists the required encrypted secrets in comments. This Worker
source is a repo-checkout deployment template, not a published npm package
entrypoint; run Wrangler from a checkout with repository dependencies
installed. The checked-in vars set `B2_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_MODE=server` and
`B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES=false`. Review the file before deploying:

```bash
cd deploy/cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run
```

If `nodejs_compat` or the current compatibility date changes, rerun the Worker
adapter unit tests, protocol tests, and `pnpm run check:cloudflare-worker-bundle`.

## Secrets

Use Worker encrypted secrets for single-tenant server mode. Include
introspection credentials only when `B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT` remains
set in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```bash
cd deploy/cloudflare-worker
export WORKER_SECRETS_FILE="$(mktemp)"
cat > "$WORKER_SECRETS_FILE" <<'EOF'
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=prod-non-master-key-id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=prod-non-master-key-secret
B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID=resource-server-client-id
B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET=resource-server-client-secret
EOF
chmod 600 "$WORKER_SECRETS_FILE"
```

For a JWKS-only Worker, remove the introspection endpoint from `vars`, omit the
introspection credential lines from the secrets file, and set the non-secret
JWKS values in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI": "https://issuer.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
"B2_OAUTH_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS": "300",
```

That configuration passes `/health` without
`B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID` or
`B2_OAUTH_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET`. Configure both introspection and JWKS
only when introspection should stay authoritative for revocation and
JWT-shaped opaque-token compatibility.

Signed-JWT tokens must carry a `kid` and a `typ` of `at+jwt`; set
`B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_JWT_TYPES` if the issuer uses a different value. Once
`B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI` is set, `B2_OAUTH_ALLOWED_ALGORITHMS` is enforced
(`RS256` by default, plus `ES256` and `EdDSA` when listed).

Do not store B2 credentials in ordinary Worker `vars`, source code, `.dev.vars`
committed to git, shell history, or logs. Use `cloudflare.env.example` only as
a checklist. For multi-tenant use, put credentials behind a reviewed secret
broker and use `B2_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_MODE=principal`; do not place a growing
customer credential map in Worker variables.
Set `B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES=false`; the Worker adapter fails closed if hosted
local file access is enabled.

## Deployment

Deploy the checked-in Worker entrypoint:

```bash
cd deploy/cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler deploy --secrets-file "$WORKER_SECRETS_FILE"
rm -f "$WORKER_SECRETS_FILE"
```

`worker.ts` passes the Web `Request` directly to the shared adapter. New routes
must remain thin and must call `src/http-fetch-handler.ts` and
`src/oauth-resource-server.ts` rather than copying their behavior.

## Domains And TLS

Attach a Cloudflare custom domain or route and set `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to that
exact hostname. Cloudflare terminates TLS at the edge. Do not expose raw port
3000 or route clients directly to a container or origin that bypasses OAuth.

## Authentication

The checked-in adapter validates OAuth bearer tokens by introspection for
opaque tokens, or by local JWT signature verification when `B2_OAUTH_JWKS_URI`
is configured without introspection. When both verifier mechanisms are
configured, introspection remains authoritative so authorization-server
revocation and JWT-shaped opaque tokens behave the same during rolling
deploys. JWKS-only mode validates signatures and claims locally, caches and
coalesces JWKS fetches, rate-limits forced key-refresh attempts, and cannot
observe revocation before JWT expiry. A Cloudflare Access or OAuth Provider
integration may run before the adapter only if it converts a verified identity
into MCP `AuthInfo`. Never trust public identity headers from the internet.

## Health Checks

`GET /health` validates static configuration and returns bounded metadata. Use
Cloudflare synthetic checks or an external monitor against `/health`, then run
authorized MCP smoke for protocol evidence.

## Smoke Testing

Run:

```bash
curl -fsS https://mcp.example.com/health
MCP_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <access-token>" \
B2_MCP_SMOKE_CREDENTIAL_MODE=server \
B2_MCP_EXPECTED_TOOL_PROFILE=phase1-default \
pnpm run smoke
```

Before upgrading the status, record Worker script version, route, region
sample, deployed commit, MCP revision, tool-contract hash, and smoke result.

## Logs

Use Workers Logs or Tail Workers for redacted diagnostics. Do not log B2
credentials, OAuth tokens, presigned URLs, or `wrangler` secret input.

## Scaling

Worker isolates are stateless. Capability caches, OAuth caches, concurrency
counters, and app rate limits are per isolate. Use Cloudflare rate limiting,
WAF, or a Durable Object when a deployment-wide guarantee is required.

## Rollback

Use Cloudflare Workers versions or rollbacks to return to a prior Worker
version. Confirm secrets still match that code path, then rerun smoke.

## Secret Rotation

Upload replacement Worker secrets with a new version, smoke that version, shift
traffic, then revoke the old B2 key:

```bash
cd deploy/cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler versions upload --secrets-file "$WORKER_SECRETS_FILE"
```

For single-secret maintenance on an existing Worker, `wrangler secret put NAME`
also creates a new Worker version. Review, smoke, and deploy that version with
the same care as a code change.

## Teardown

Delete the Worker route/custom domain, delete Worker secrets, remove live smoke
secrets, and revoke the B2 key.

## Limitations

The Worker path is experimental until live smoke evidence exists. Verify the
official B2 SDK, residual AWS S3 compatibility path, Pino, Opossum, DNS and
network validation, timers, Web streams, aborts, and cryptography under the
current Worker runtime. If bundle or runtime compatibility cannot be satisfied
without weakening the shared codebase, use Cloudflare Containers instead.

## Cost Controls

Use a paid-plan CPU budget appropriate for MCP requests, provider rate limits,
and B2-side quotas. Avoid proxying large object bodies through the Worker; use
presigned B2 transfers.

## Troubleshooting

Use the shared security contract first:
[docs/references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md](security-and-credentials.md).

- Auth discovery: fetch `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` and confirm the resource URL, issuer, authorization endpoint, and supported scopes match the MCP client configuration.
- Issuer/audience mismatch: compare `B2_OAUTH_ISSUER`, `B2_OAUTH_RESOURCE`, and `B2_OAUTH_AUDIENCE` with the token claims returned by the authorization server.
- Host/Origin rejection: confirm the public host is in `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and any browser-origin caller is in `B2_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; do not expose raw port 3000 while testing a bypass.
- Missing B2 capabilities: verify the B2 key has the specific read/write/admin capabilities required by the called tool and that `B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS` has not hidden a discovery failure.
- Timeouts: check the platform request timeout, OAuth introspection timeout, upstream B2 latency, and any proxy idle timeout before increasing MCP limits.
- Bundle limits: run the repository bundle or package budget check for this deployment path and remove unreviewed dependencies before raising limits.
- Cold starts: inspect platform cold-start logs, minimum instance settings, and secret-loading latency; keep health checks separate from expensive B2 calls.
- Failed health checks: call `GET /health` with the expected Host header, then verify credential-mode env vars, OAuth metadata env vars, and provider secret injection.
