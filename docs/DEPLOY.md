# Deployment Guide

This is the deployment index for customer-hosted B2 MCP endpoints. Use it to
choose a supported path, then follow the linked guide for the provider. Every
hosted deployment must keep B2 credentials in the server, provider secret
store, or customer secret broker; the MCP client and LLM harness must not hold
or forward B2 application keys.

Shared production rules are in
[`references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md`](references/deployment/security-and-credentials.md).
Provider guides link back to that file instead of repeating credential,
rotation, CI secret, teardown, health-check, and smoke-test policy.

Supported Node.js runtimes are the repository runtimes, not provider defaults:
Node.js `22.23.1`, Node.js `24`, and Node.js `26`. Do not add Node 18, 20, 23,
or 25 support. The package engine range is `^22.22.2 || ^24 || ^26`, and
release/build examples use
`pnpm@11.20.0+sha256.34e198cb1e43237517ecedfd31f9ae26a6c0a3e5366ce58a2d05f4b21fb5f19a`.

## Support Levels

- **Supported and continuously tested**: maintained code path with deterministic
  CI coverage in this repository. A live deployment still needs protected smoke
  evidence before an operator calls that tenant production-ready.
- **OCI-compatible**: supported application artifact through the portable image,
  but provider-specific managed-hosting behavior is not continuously live-smoked
  by this repository.
- **Experimental compatibility**: recipe or adapter is documented for operators
  to evaluate. Do not claim support until a clean deploy and protected smoke run
  are recorded for the exact release.

## Shared Validation

Every supported deployment needs this smoke sequence from a trusted environment:

1. `GET /health`.
2. OAuth protected-resource discovery when OAuth is enabled.
3. Unauthorized `/mcp` rejection.
4. Authorized MCP initialization or discovery.
5. `tools/list` contract hash comparison.
6. One representative read-only B2 call.
7. One explicitly confirmed disposable write/delete workflow when allowed.
8. Log and redaction verification.
9. Cleanup verification.

For stdio containers, pass `--no-healthcheck` so the runtime does not probe an
HTTP endpoint that is intentionally absent. For HTTP containers, set `PORT`, not only `--port`, so the container health check targets the same port the server binds.

Protected live smokes run from GitHub Environments and never from untrusted fork
or pull request code. Record deployed commit, artifact digest, Node version,
MCP revision, platform region/runtime, tool-contract hash, and result. A failed
provider smoke downgrades that recipe's support claim until repaired.

Rolling deploy note: MCP resources are an additive advertised capability.
During a mixed-version stateless HTTP rollout, a client that initialized against
a new replica can briefly send `resources/list` or `resources/read` to an old
replica and receive method-not-found. Treat that as expected, bounded rollout
skew; it self-heals once all replicas run the same version.

The supported container operator runbook is
[`deploy/customer-hosted/README.md`](../deploy/customer-hosted/README.md).
Treat that README as the canonical source for build/run steps, secret injection,
nginx OAuth and mTLS policy, rolling deploys, pinned image updates, bounded
logging, and capacity guidance.

The supported Vercel adapter runbook is
[`deploy/vercel/README.md`](../deploy/vercel/README.md). It documents the
adapter already shipped in `deploy/vercel/`; do not add a second Vercel
handler.
